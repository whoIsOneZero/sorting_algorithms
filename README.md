# sorting_algorithms
ALX project on sorting algorithms and the Big-O notation.

## What I learnt
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
